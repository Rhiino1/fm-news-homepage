## My process

We had to start from something, in this case from scratch. I haven't done challenges from a while, being busy with stuff IRL. I choose this one because is an easy one to try new things, one of them is tailwindcss.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library

### What I learned

First of all, I'm learning tailwindcss, I know something about CSS but I was often trying to guess and discover how to do things in tailwind, for example:

```html
<section
  id="card"
  className="w-[330px] h-auto pt-4 pb-10 flex flex-col gap-5
justify-evenly items-center bg-white rounded-2xl"
></section>
```

Everything above is already known to me, but I had to check the docs from tailwind to know how to spell it.

### Continued development

I manage certain things fitting some arbitrary values on styles, but I researched that tailwind offers customization on `tailwind.config.js` so next time I will use it properly.

I do know using React for a such simple thing Its kinda overengineering, however, this is just the beginning to a series of challenges, thus, I made a React + Tailwind template to work with.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - There is all the information and knowledge you need to start learning Tailwindcss.
- [Hamburger menu with React and Tailwindcss](https://www.codementor.io/@giorgiasambrotta/hamburger-menu-with-react-and-tailwind-css-1qx6sruvua) - This one help me making a good hamb menu.
- [Convert a color](https://convertacolor.com/) Simple web to convert colors between models.
- [Each child should have a unique key prop](https://www.datainfinities.com/18/each-child-in-a-list-should-have-a-unique-key-prop) Helped me with the warning with the same name.
